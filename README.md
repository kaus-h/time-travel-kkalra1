## Time Travel Zine

This project is about a fictional zine about building a time machine. It demonstrates Git workflow and version control through github


### Why .gitignore?
The .gitignore file helps avoid committing unnecessary files like logs, system metadata, or editor/IDE caches. This keeps the repo clean and focused.


### Branching Strategy
- `author/idea-sprint`: For drafting new zine ideas and content.
- `editor/review`: For reviewing, editing, and polishing content before merging to master.
